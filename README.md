# NodejsMVCExpressWeb-ProjectMaoltech

This 2016 project is a "for fun" personal project exploring the Nodejs/Expressjs frameworks in my spare time.

Its a MVC patterned Nodejs website that is on Expressjs framework backed by MongoDB. Its a static website for an Information Technology company using the aforementioned technologies. The 2016 project ran into 503 difficulties when trying to deploy on Heroku due to MongoDB provision on platform. Suspended the project due to my Higher Diploma in Science in Computing but will in time return to debug the project, fix MongoDB record inserts in the backend and deploy the site. Do note that record inserts intitially worked but as I did not have version control at the time, my efforts with others to fix the 503 errors accidentially deleted the DB and the inserts have not been correct since. I then started my Higher Diploma course at DBS and could not action a remedy for the db insert issue due to me suspending the project in favour of my studies. First order of business when I eventually restart on this project will be to fix this db insert issue, regain full site functionality via the admin panel and then deploy the site.
